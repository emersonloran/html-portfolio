<h1>The Best Movies According to Emerson</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite movie of all time. I can remeber exactly how I felt when I
  was watching, all the emotions and the goosebumps on the plot twist.
</p>

<h3>Never Back Down</h3>
<p>
  Watched this movie at least 20 times as a teenager, has been year since the
  last time I watched but still have all the nostalgia.
</p>

<h3>Mother</h3>
<p>
  A very single movie with a completely different plot twist with great
  perfomances by the actors.
